# chains as planned, new plans will be schedule at each minute mark; and the
# CDR will be running at all times.  So we make the agent to work in two
# steps: the new_evaluation_cycle that simply schedules a new cycle, which
# expires after 65s; and this method, when execute, schedules the entire plan.
