    '''A partner represents an entity that you do business with.

    That can be a prospect, a customer, a supplier, or even an employee of
    your company.

    In `XOPGI`, "fax" field is discarded because this concept is not used any
    more in modern world.

    `OpenERP` assumes that each new partner is a customer by default. This is
    ugly, but the only way to fix it is by modifying all usability scenarios
    (`OpenERP` views) in order to get a different value for each context. Also
    there are other classes of partners semantically in the same level of
    "customer" or "suplier" that must be included but it's difficult because
    these are boolean attributes.
