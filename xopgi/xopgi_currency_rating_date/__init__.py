'''Differentiate the date for currency rating computation.

Odoo normally uses today or the key 'date' in the context to compute the
currency rates.  However, this key is also used in other places for other
purposes (pricelist selection, etc).

We create the 'currency_rating_date' key in the context to force a different
date for currency rate computations.  You may pass either a datetime, a date,
or a string (as Odoo requires).
